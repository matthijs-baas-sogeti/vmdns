# VM AdguardDNS

This will create a VM in Azure using Terraform which configures Ubuntu and installs AdGuardHome.

It will create a public IP which you can use as your DNS. ( See picture below )
This will filter your internet traffic to deny ad serving websites and known malicious websites
using several blocklists including [OISD](https://oisd.nl/)
